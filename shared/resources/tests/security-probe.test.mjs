/**
 * security-probe — the four verdicts, the states that must not collapse, and the

 *
 * The point of this suite is the STATE SEPARATION, not the happy path. Every
 * defect in the series this task closes has the same shape: two distinguishable
 * conditions rendered as one value, where one of them looks like success.
 * `probes_executed: 0` read as a pass. `declined` folded into `executed: 0`. A
 * stub that throws on everything scored as a control that engages. Each of those
